# Bank-Loan-Report
## Project Overview
## Problem Statement
This project addressed the critical need to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance through the development of a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. The primary goal was to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their temporal variations, enabling data-driven decision-making. The report aimed to track the health of our loan portfolio, identify trends, and inform lending strategies for optimized performance.

### Dashboard 1: Summary
#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Achievements:
#### 1)Total Loan Applications:
Calculated the total number of loan applications received during specified periods.
Monitored Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and tracked changes Month-over-Month (MoM).

#### 2)Total Funded Amount:
Understood the total amount of funds disbursed as loans.
Monitored the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyzed the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

#### 3)Total Amount Received:
Tracked the total amount received from borrowers for assessing cash flow and loan repayment.
Analyzed the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observed the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

#### 4)Average Interest Rate:
Calculated the average interest rate across all loans, MTD.
Monitored the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates.

#### 5)Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):
Evaluated the average DTI for our borrowers.
Computed the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and tracked Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.

#### 6)Good Loan v Bad Loan KPIs Accomplishments
#### Good Loan KPIs:
##### Good Loan Application Percentage:
Calculated the percentage of loan applications classified as 'Good Loans,' including 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'

##### Good Loan Applications:
Identified the total number of loan applications falling under the 'Good Loan' category.

##### Good Loan Funded Amount:
Determined the total amount of funds disbursed as 'Good Loans,' including the principal amounts of loans with a loan status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'

##### Good Loan Total Received Amount:
Tracked the total amount received from borrowers for 'Good Loans,' encompassing all payments made on loans with a loan status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'
#### Bad Loan KPIs:
##### Bad Loan Application Percentage:
Calculated the percentage of loan applications categorized as 'Bad Loans,' specifically 'Charged Off.'
##### Bad Loan Applications:
Identified the total number of loan applications categorized as 'Bad Loans,' consisting of loans with a loan status of 'Charged Off.'

##### Bad Loan Funded Amount:
Determined the total amount of funds disbursed as 'Bad Loans,' comprising the principal amounts of loans with a loan status of 'Charged Off.'

##### Bad Loan Total Received Amount:
Tracked the total amount received from borrowers for 'Bad Loans,' including all payments made on loans with a loan status of 'Charged Off.'

##### Loan Status Grid View Implementation
To gain a comprehensive overview of lending operations and monitor loan performance, successfully created a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.' This report provides valuable insights into key indicators associated with different loan statuses, including 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'MTD Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI).'

#### Dashboard 2: Overview
Visual Representation Achievements
In the Bank Loan Report project, successfully implemented various chart types to visually represent critical loan-related metrics and trends, facilitating data-driven decision-making. Below are the specific chart accomplishments:

#### Monthly Trends by Issue Date:
Objective: Successfully showcased how these metrics varied over time, allowing identification of seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.

#### Regional Analysis by State:
Objective: Successfully visually represented lending metrics categorized by state, identifying regions with significant lending activity and assessing regional disparities.

#### Loan Term Analysis:
Objective: Successfully depicted loan statistics based on different loan terms, allowing understanding of the distribution of loans across various term lengths.

#### Employee Length Analysis:
Objective: Successfully illustrated how lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.

#### Loan Purpose Breakdown:
Objective: Successfully provided a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.

#### Home Ownership Analysis:
Objective: Successfully displayed loan metrics categorized by different home ownership statuses hierarchically.

#### Dashboard 3: Details
#### Details Dashboard Implementation
Acknowledging the need for a comprehensive view of essential information within our loan data, successfully implemented the Details Dashboard. It provided a consolidated snapshot of key loan-related metrics and data points, enabling users to access critical information efficiently.

#### Objective Accomplishments
The primary objective of the Details Dashboard was successfully achieved by providing a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It served as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.

### Insights
1. Total loan applications were 38.6K, up 6.9% month-over-month (MOM). This indicates growing demand for loans.
2. 13.8% of loan applications were classified as "bad loans". The majority (86.2%) were "good loans". This suggests relatively low bad loan risk overall.
3. Total loan amount funded was $435.8M for good loans and $65.5M for bad loans. Average interest rates were 12% for good loans and 15.1% for bad loans.
4. By month, funded loan amounts peaked in January at $116M and declined later in the year. This could indicate seasonal variation in loan demand.  
5. By state, over 60% of funded loan amount came from one state. This points to geographic concentration risk.
6. By loan term, 36 month loans were most common, followed by 60 month loans. This shows consumer preference for shorter-term loans.  
7. Debt consolidation was the most common loan purpose (32%), followed by credit card refinancing (18%). This suggests consumers are using loans to manage existing debts.
8. More funded amount comes from mortgage holders ($219M) compared to renters ($186M). This indicates homeowners are taking out larger loans than renters on average.
